# Drupal projects

Here's some links to Drupal projects we've contributed or help maintain on d.o.

* [ngApp](https://www.drupal.org/project/ngapp) - This module turns your site in to an AngularJS application. Its goal is to help you start using Angular on your site very quickly, optionally using popular contrib modules for retrieving JSON data from local RESTful endpoints.

* [Advanced User](https://www.drupal.org/project/advuser) - Took this beast over from the original contributor...

* [Open AdStream](https://www.drupal.org/project/openadstream) - Worked with a client, the orginal contributor to get _[chrisryan's](https://github.com/chrisryan)_ original D7 port up on d.o.
