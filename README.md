# Drupal projects

Here's some links to Drupal projects we maintain, have contributed heavily to or just help iterate on d.o.

* [ngApp](https://www.drupal.org/project/ngapp) - This module turns your site in to an AngularJS application. Its goal is to help you start using Angular on your site very quickly, optionally using popular contrib modules for retrieving JSON data from local RESTful endpoints.

* [Supercookie](https://www.drupal.org/project/supercookie) - This module sets a persistent, unique cookie and corresponding database session record within the specified expiration interval for every site visitor, regardless of their user agent (browser) settings.

* [Content API](https://www.drupal.org/project/contentapi) - This was kind of a "game changer" a few years back. Still some pretty awesome stuff, all in all.

* [Advanced User](https://www.drupal.org/project/advuser) - Took this beast over from the original maintainer...patches very welcome.

* [Open AdStream](https://www.drupal.org/project/openadstream) - Worked with a client and the mod maintainer to get [chrisryan's original D7 port](https://github.com/chrisryan/openadstream) up on d.o., adding support for OAS' latest schema in the process.
